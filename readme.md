# Learning Elm

## The input widget

In `io.elm` is a text field with Enter (save) and Cancel (reset) actions,
inspired by what we used on Kashana.

Other stuff we had in Kashana include:

- Widgets with 2 text fiels in: name and description
- lists of these widgets
- lists with a placeholder item 
- some of the placeholder details are inactive until it is created
